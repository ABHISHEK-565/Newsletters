Hey Hey, as you may have known by now, this is yet another edition of SemiKolan Newsletter.

Here are some useful links and resources which anyone can access for free, important technological events throughout the week and some general Semikolan updates for this week - 

1. You've seen Github Copilot, it's time for Open AI Codex now: Codex, developed by Open AI is an AI system created with an aim to translate natural language to code. In fact, codex is the model that's powering Github Copilot. Learn more here: https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/

2. Github Codespaces: As you may have noticed, we're still not over with Github's new features, and another addition to that is Github Codespaces.

7. Hack this fall 2.0: Looking for hacking with some cool people and promote open source. Join Hack this fall, a hackathon where you'll get nice prizes as well as an experience to build some cool stuff, I'm also a part of their community and we'll be representing the Semikolan community there too. :) Do join in through https://hackthisfall.devpost.com/

We would also like to announce two new features coming very soon on Semikolan - direct registration in Semikolan blogs so that anyone can create an account and write blogs, and YouTube videos from the Semikolan community which you'll be seeing very soon.

That’s all we have for this week’s newsletter.
